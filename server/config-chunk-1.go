Here's the Go code equivalent to the given code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Please note that I've provided the code with code fences for better readability. If you need it without code fences, here it is:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```
